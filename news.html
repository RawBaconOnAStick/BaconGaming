        <h1>BaconGaming leaks first image from new game</h1>
        <h5>June 25th</h5>
        <p>Since declaring the start of development of a new tycoon game, Bacon Gaming has been
            relatively quiet about the game. However, today they released part of what seems to be
            a logo for the new game. Below, you can see the leak.

        <h1>Tycoon game Announced</h1>
        <h5>June 9th</h5>
        <p>BGStudio declared a new game was starting development soon, and now they have delivered.
            Rumor has it that the new game's goal is to accumulate as much money as possible.
            Do this by growing your businesses, hiring employees, and more. There has been no date set, 
            but beta versions are expected to release around late June. The official stable release
            is expected to come in mid-early July. Keep up with news from BGStudio games for more
            updates on the release, concept art, and leaks.

        <h1>New Games Arriving Soon</h1>
        <h5>June 8th</h5>
        <p>Bacon Gaming Studio has announced that a new game will enter development in the very near
            future. Rohan Dharwadker has confirmed that the game will not be the second installment
            of the X Fight series, but rather a new concept. Some rumors say that they may be exploring a
            tycoon type of game, while others speculate that a small, low quality game is being
            considered.

        <img class="news_img" src="pics/ff_logo.PNG"/>
        <h5>May 30th</h5>
        <p>The beta version of Forever Fight: 2019 is here. This will give gamers a chance to get a solid
            first look at the game. Bug fixes and minor edits will come with the official release, but
            major changes aren't likely. The beta version has been released for free, so you can most
            likely expect the official release to be free as well.

        <h1>A New Game is Coming.</h1>
        <h5>May 29th</h5>
        <p>Bacon Gaming Studio is proud to announce the development of the latest game to its collection,
            Forever Fight: 2019. Forever Fight: 2019 is the first of many from the X Fight series. The
            X fight series are a set of fighting games that all center around the same concept of
            player vs player. Each game features a different type of character, for example, Superheroes,
            Aliens, Gladiators, Vikings, etc. Though BG Studio is releasing the original, Forever Fight, they
            have not made any statements regarding the making of sequels. Rohan Dharwadker thinks that their
            time could be better spent making differen types of games first. No release date is officially
            set, but Forever Fight is expected to release around late June.</p>
